    <h1>Invitation Card Project Overview</h1>
    <p>This folder contains a visually engaging invitation card experience implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features elegantly styled cards with a front and back design that flip with smooth 3D animations on user interaction.</p>
    <div class="card">
      <p>The design emphasizes a refined dark theme background with subtle starry animations to create an inviting ambiance. The cards use modern styling with shadows, rounded corners, and transform effects for a premium look and feel.</p>
      <p>This single-page setup ensures a seamless interactive experience where clicking on the card triggers a continuous tilt animation followed by a flip transition switching between the front and back sides.</p>
